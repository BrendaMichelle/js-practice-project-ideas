Create an application using as many different event interactions as possible. If you're not able to think of a project idea, see the list below for inspiration. Here's a list of possible events: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp

The purpose of this exercise is to practice DOM manipulation and event handling. Styling and HTML should only be added programatically (using Javascript). Don't worry if your project is not visually appealing - that's not the point of this 😄

- Recreate a version of this [example project](https://will-bush.github.io/event-listener-fun/). 
- Create a calculator where a number on the pinpad changes its color whenever it's clicked on
- Create a hangman game
